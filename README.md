# Sales Prediction with XGBoost
This repository contains code examples and resources for sales prediction using the XGBoost library. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning library that provides an implementation of gradient boosting algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed, as well as the following libraries:

* XGBoost
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

# Getting Started
To get started with sales prediction using the XGBoost library, you can check out the examples folder, which contains Jupyter notebooks with code examples and explanations for different aspects of the sales prediction problem.

The data folder contains sample data files that you can use to test your own sales prediction models. The data includes historical sales data for several products, which you can use to train and validate different forecasting models.
